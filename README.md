# Wastewater_Microbial_Markers
Machine Learning-Based Identification of Wastewater Treatment Plant-Specific Microbial Markers Using 16S rRNA Sequencing

This project includes the code used in the machine learning part of the article. The input data used in each code set is the table of relative abundance of all bacteria and archae calculated for each wastewater treatment plant samples (CodeEffsDF). The raw sequences are available from the NCBI SRA under BioProject ID PRJNA1177763, with accessions SAMN44450032â€“SAMN44450088.

The repository contains:
1. CodeEffsDF.csv - data frame for the relative abundance of all bacteria genus found from the six studied wastewater treatment plants
2. EffSHAPanalysis.py - SHAP analysis
3. KvalueSMOTEandModelsOptimising.py - Optimising model (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree), k-value and SMOTE ratio for the data.
